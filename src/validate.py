"""Stage 3 — validate the *derived* common core against an official catalogue.

The German ELWIS bank is the project's one ground-truth-valid bank: it *is* the
amtliche Fragenkatalog. The CH and FR banks are *derived* from law, of unmeasured
fidelity. Because :mod:`src.scope` tags every question by harmonised base
(``universal``/``cevni``/``colregs``), the official German questions on a shared
base can act as a yardstick for the derived ones on the *same* base — the only
non-circular cross-check available (one side is official; the classifier restricts
the comparison to genuinely shared scope).

Two instruments, deliberately different in cost and confidence:

  * :func:`coverage` — deterministic, ``$0``, CI-friendly. Reports, per harmonised
    base, (1) an **instrumentation rate** — what fraction of the official bank any
    instrument can even see, so no figure is read as covering more than it measures;
    (2) a **bounded coverage figure** on that instrumented slice, via the shared
    ``principle`` tag, weighted by how often the official bank tests each topic; and
    (3) a fine-grained, hand-curated **concept probe** (precise but low-reach) that
    spot-checks individual harmonised concepts. It answers "how much of what the
    official bank tests — and that I can actually measure — does my derived bank
    carry?", never "is an answer right". The untagged remainder is reported as
    explicitly unmeasured rather than silently assumed covered.

  * :func:`flag_divergences` — an on-demand **divergence flagger** (LLM). For a
    derived question matched to the official catalogue on a shared concept, it asks
    whether the derived keyed answer *contradicts* what the official catalogue
    establishes. It emits disagreements for a human to review — NOT a pass/fail
    score: the harmonised codes are harmonised, *not identical*, so a flag may be a
    legitimate national derogation rather than an error. Costs tokens; ``--deep``.

The concept checklist below is a deliberately auditable *starting point* (like the
keyword sets in :mod:`src.scope`): every concept names itself and carries the
harmonised base it belongs to. Extend it as the banks grow.
