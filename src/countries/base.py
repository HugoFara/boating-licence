A :class:`Country` bundles everything that varies between national exams: which
sources ground it, the exam-theme taxonomy + the tagger that sorts units into it,
the recreational-permit catalogue, the regional variance (cantons / Länder / a
shared-lake regime) and the legal basis for reuse. The Swiss instance
(:mod:`countries.ch`) is a thin adapter over the original flat modules; new
countries (:mod:`countries.de`) are defined natively against these types.

    (fees, age thresholds, validity periods) are marked ``volatile`` so they can be
